Michael,



We take the health and safety of our community seriously and want to remind
you of the existing options available for deliveries. If you prefer a
no-contact delivery or need to request one for health reasons* you can make
that request today in the delivery instructions. Dashers may also reach out
to you through a call or text message when you place an order to request a
no-contact delivery as well.


If a no-contact delivery is requested, the Dasher will leave your food in a
safe place and alert you when it’s ready for pickup. Here’s how this works
if you’d like to request one:

   1. *Add instructions.* At checkout, update the “Delivery Instructions”
   section with your request for a no-contact delivery and with details about
   the drop-off location. Please be specific about the location and
   instructions.
   2. *Text your Dasher.* When your Dasher is assigned select the option to
   text your Dasher. In the message, remind them of your request and consider
   sending a photo of the drop-off location.
   3. *Dasher will confirm drop-off.* When your Dasher arrives, they’ll
   text you that they’ve left your order at the requested drop-off location.
   You’ll also receive a message in-app that your order has been delivered.

We are testing enhanced drop-off options for customers that are coming soon
to our app and website. We’ll roll these out in the coming days and will
continue to communicate with you during this evolving situation.


Thanks,

The DoorDash Customer Support Team


*For those who are ill or who have been in contact with others who may be
ill, this is particularly important to protect the health of the Dasher
community.
